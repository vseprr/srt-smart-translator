00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,500
I went to the store yesterday

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,000
and bought some fresh milk.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,500
The weather was really nice,

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,000
so I decided to walk home.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,500
It took about twenty minutes
but I enjoyed every moment.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,500
When I got home, I made

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,000
a delicious cup of coffee.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Sometimes the simple things in life
bring the most joy.
